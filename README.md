# Centric Software Frontend Test

This is a little project to demostrate my skills in Vue.js

This project brings some pokemon from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and shows them in a list. You can click on a pokemon to see its details.
Also, you can click in the imgage of the pokemon to count how many times you clicked on it.
